REQUIRES FFMPEG and CUDA TOOLKIT

execute bash_make.sh (lazy makefile)

test takes 2 arguments, 
  argument 1 is a text file with paths to BMP images 1 per line
    example: ./BMP/0001.bmp
  argument 2 is an rtsp endpoint to setup the stream
    example: rtsp://127.0.0.1/live56



How to use the GPU libary:

The user only needs to use 5 different functions.
  init_rtsp_stream
  start_rtsp_stream
  write_image_to_rtsp_stream
  end_rtsp_stream
  free_rtsp_stream

init_rtsp_stream 
  takes an RTSPStream object, 
           width, 
           height, 
           fps, 
           bitrate, 
           and endpoint.
  This will setup all of the necessary structures and codec parameters to send
  frames to the encoder. 

start_rtsp_stream
  takes an RTSPStream object that has been initialized.
  This simple function will establish a stream with the rtsp server

write_image_to_rtsp_stream
  takes an RTSPStream object that has been initialized and started,
           and bgra image.
  BMP image header is still left over and not used. Used for testing purposes.
  For use with the VNC server only the data member needs to be set.

end_rtsp_stream
  takes an RTSPStream object that has been initialized and started.
  This simple function will teardown the stream from the rtsp server.
  If this function is not called the stream will remain open and the endpoint
  unusable until the rtsp server closes the stream.

free_rtsp_stream
  takes an RTSPStream object.
  This looks at each member of the object and frees any memory allocated to it
  if it exists. This function should be called on error and when a stream has
  concluded to remove any memory leaks that could occur.
